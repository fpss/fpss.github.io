title:  "Creating opportunities"

info: "We ensure that our graduates across all of the departments within the faculty of business and economics are provided with enriching experiences that will enable them to make meaningful and worthwhile contributions to society. The society will have standing committee of member who will maintain our constitution and ensure that the society is representative of students needs across the faculty of business and economics. The standing committee will ensure that appropriate funding and governance structures ensure that students are represented in a legitimate and meaningful way. The society aims to achieve this through the following"

info-item: " - Through seminars that invite thought leaders, politicians, community leaders, academics and media to discuss events that are relevant and apt. Such events will seek to provide students with opportunities to make connections with people from across the private and public sector.<br>

- Alongside these topical seminars, our annual conference will provide students with an opportunity to organise and coordinate conferences across the diverse disciplines within our faculty and where appropriate we will deliver our conference in partnership with other universities. Our conference will provide students at all stages in the PhD with an opportunity to build valuable skills and enduring relationships with the community of scholars.<br>

 - Our website will be a current repository of matters that are relevant to all students across our faculty. Such matters will include opportunities relating to the job market, funding, internships, seminars and upskilling."
